# dotkeeper

A *keeper* for your *dotfiles*. See what I did there? *(booooooo)*

To get started, create a folder in `~/.dotkeep` with the name of your **keep**. A **keep** is a place where dots are kept. Like a **plot** in Rancher.

You can move `~/.ranch` to `~/.dotkeep`, and rename any `plot.json` files to `keep.json`.

See more documentation in the **Wiki**
